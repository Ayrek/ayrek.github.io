                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>The target audience of this site are middle-aged adults. This target audience usually has a larger amount of people that are dependant on them or an amount of people they need to provide to. For example adults with families or a small business. As well, they will most likely have at least a high school education, if not a college degre- putting them in the middle class group.
                </p>
                <p>Costco wants their customers to buy even more of their products. The site is simple to navigate and locate anything that you would want to find. It is not too cluttered with links and information where the user can feel overwhelmed. Right when the Costco homepage is loaded in the screen, all the content was organized, alligned, and pleasing the to the eye. With a nice red, white, blue, and gray color scheme throughout, the site looks modern and professional. Perfect for the middle-aged adult parent and small businessman.
                </p>
                <p>The content was organized in a way where what was to be searched was easily found. Right on the top middle, easily visible, is the search bar. And located below it, is the function to search by department and category if needed. Besides that, on the homepage are located the current sales and "hot" products currently offered by Costco.
                </p>
                <p>Costco made the mobile expierence enjoyable. In the browser of the mobile device, Costco's webpage displays the essentials, yet adding options. As can be noticed in the desktop site, there are not as many details, but mobile website creates a nice balance. This allows the capability of the mobile site to load faster and not to be cramped with the same information as the desktop site. And when the user searches for various products, the interface is easy to use and filter the results.</p>

                <h1>Site Contrast</h1>
                <h3>CNET vs. Costco</h3>
                <p>Url: http://www.cnet.com/</p>
                <figure>

                    CNET doesn't do a great job of addressing a specific target audience. They range from tech news to car information. Versus Costco has a nice layout and products available for a specific group of audience.</p>
                <p>
                   CNET does do a good job of meeting the needs of their audience. However, it can seem to be a little overboard with too much of a range of information available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their contect is not well organized on the page. Upon loading the page, the mind is overwhelmed with giant images and text overlay. It confusing to understand what is going on at first. The page is very crowded with little whitespace and the allignment is bad, seems scattered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mobile version is not appealing for visitors either. The layout seems to be just placed their and they hope that the visitor will find their way around. Costco on the other hand is very smooth and better organized with great use of whitespace in their mobile version to allow easier navigation.
