    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <h3>Reviewer: Allan Alberro</h3>
    <p>Starting off with the smart phone device, I must say I really like it. The main reason I use weather apps are for quick glances of what the weather will be like, and I actually like that you have each day of the week visible versus having to scroll through or click next.
        <p>Moving onto the tablet, again, I really like the layout and the simplicity. The only thing I would maybe recommend would be having a search bar on the tablet. You have it on the browser and I'd like having that option open on a tablet. On the smart device, not so much because you're just looking for current/weekly weather.</p>
        <p>The browser layout is great! It follows the F shape that is important for where the users eyes will be going. The only suggestion I could think of is having one main photo area at least for the top half. There does seem to be a number of images, which is fine, I've seen a lot of weather/news sites with a lot of boxes and images, but I think you could maybe have a main image on the browser and then other smaller ones.</p>
        <h3>Response</h3>
        <p>After consideration fo the comments and suggestions of Allen I have decided to add in a search bar in the IPad outline. However, I have decided to go ahead with my original plans of my desktop outline. I have decided to take this route because I believe that the user will easily enough identify the main element of the page. And I f increase the main image too much then it will be over dominating in the page.</p>
